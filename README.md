Hi, i'm Andrea, a Junior Full Stack Web Developer and a Python Data Science appassionate.
I'm here to meet new colleagues and work on some coding together! 🌱

ABOUT ME:
In 2013 i finished high school for computer technology, but i didn't like it and i started working as a technical assistant for telecomunications.
In these years after school i did running, cycling and gym at a very high level and, in order to take track of every workout i had created a big database with Google Sheets.
Soon i wanted to study those data and i started to make analysis on them, evolving my database in a powerbase of more than 80 columns to monitor almost everything.

Then, at the end of 2023, i wanted to learn to program and i started with Python.
At first with the help of Chat GPT, then with SoloLearn app.
One day, one friend talked about Data Camp's courses and i joined them.

Actually i'm almost 200 hours into Python courses and i'm super-focused on Data Science and Machine-Learning!! ⚡⚡

Now i work as a Junior Full Stack Web Developer in the same telecomunications' Company.
Php, node.js, mysql, fastify, react, html, css are my new friends and even thought Python isn't there, i always take every i learn from work in something to create with Python on my own! 👀

I hope to meet you soon!

Andrea
