# Junior Full Stack Web Developer - Python Keras Deep Learning and Data Science appassionate! ðŸš€
_Nice to meet you! I'm **Andrea** and I'm here to meet new colleagues and work on some coding together! ðŸŒ±_
<br><br>

# High School and Sports:
In 2013 i finished high school for computer technology, but i didn't like it and i started working as a technical assistant for telecomunications.
In these years after school i did running, cycling and gym at a very high level and, in order to take track of every workout i had created a big database with Google Sheets.
Soon i wanted to study those data and i started to make analysis on them, evolving my database in a powerbase of more than 80 columns to monitor almost everything.

# Python, the first love:
At the end of 2023 i wanted to learn to program and i started with Python.
At first with the help of Chat GPT, then with SoloLearn app.
One day, one friend talked about Data Camp's courses and i joined them.

# Present days:
Actually i've done more 300 hours into Python programming and courses and i'm super-focused on Data Science and Deep Learning!! âš¡âš¡

Now i work as a Junior Full Stack Web Developer in the same telecomunications' Company.
Php, node.js, mysql, fastify, react, html, css are my new friends and even thought Python isn't there, i always take every i learn from work in something to create with Python on my own! ðŸ‘€

I've also created Telegram Bots and i'm currently into Deep Learning model creations with Python Keras. âš¡
I'm working on a Lichess Chess Bot (you can check my repo) with high performance!
I'll post here some of my models! âš¡

I hope to meet you soon! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
